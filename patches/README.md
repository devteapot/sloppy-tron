# Patched dependencies

These patches are mirrored from `devteapot/sloppy`. SloppyTron currently
depends on Sloppy through `github:devteapot/sloppy`; Bun resolves Sloppy's
patched dependencies from the consuming repository, so these files need to be
present here until Sloppy no longer carries the patches.

Each patch here is local tech debt. We carry it until the upstream fix lands; then we drop the patch and the corresponding `patchedDependencies` entry in `package.json`.

When you add a patch, add an entry below with the same shape: what it changes, why, and the removal condition.

## `@slop-ai/core@0.2.0`

**What it changes:** Adds `optional?: boolean` to `ParamDef` and updates `normalizeParams` to skip required-marking for parameters flagged optional, so providers can declare optional affordance arguments without the JSON schema rejecting omissions.

**Why:** The shipped 0.2.0 treats every declared param as required, which forces every Sloppy provider that wants an optional argument to either re-marshal params or fork the descriptor. The patch is the smallest viable fix.

**Remove when:** SLOP core ships native optional-param support (track upstream — TODO: file an issue and link it here once available).

## `@slop-ai/consumer@0.2.0`

**What it changes:** Fixes `isFieldSegment` so mutations under `/<node>/affordances` are classified as field updates rather than child additions. Without this, mirrors over a focused subtree miss affordance changes.

**Why:** The bug surfaces as stale tool surfaces in the run loop — affordances added or removed dynamically don't propagate to the model context until the consumer re-subscribes.

**Remove when:** SLOP consumer fixes the segment classification upstream (TODO: link the upstream PR/commit here once filed).
